Separate databases for ontology and data graph
- "Meta" shows up in relationship labels
- Relationships can only have one type and NO labels
- Con: have to query two different dbs when using the ontology
- Con: have to explain to everyone and their mother that we need two dbs

Is there a way to standardize an instance of Obsidian?

Can get the repo as a zip... how do we get that to NIPR?

Up next:
Insert data... is there a better way than unwind?
- [ ] Try py2neo package
- [ ] Try constraints
- [ ] Try assertions on allowable relationships vs meta graph
- [x] Try Neo4j python package stuff
- [ ] Try using meta to do something within python
- [ ] Try dictionary data insert
